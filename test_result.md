#### Technical Analysis

##### Html5QrcodeScanner Configuration
- **Library Integration:** html5-qrcode library properly imported and configured ✅
- **Scanner Types:** Both SCAN_TYPE_CAMERA and SCAN_TYPE_FILE supported ✅
- **File Upload Support:** File upload functionality implemented and working ✅
- **Scanner Initialization:** Scanner initializes correctly with proper configuration ✅

##### QR Processing Logic
- **Expected Format:** Scanner expects plain stock code (e.g., "STK-0001") as QR content
- **Processing Function:** Code looks for stock in stocks array using: `stocks.find(s => s.stock_code === decodedText)`
- **Success Actions:** Should call `addItemToDispatch(stock)` and `setBulkDispatchDialogOpen(true)`
- **Toast Message:** Should show `toast.success(\`Added \${stock.stock_code} to dispatch!\`)`

##### Potential Issues Identified
1. **QR Content Format:** The QR code at /tmp/stock_qrcode.png may not contain the expected plain text "STK-0001"
2. **Scanner Callback:** The QR scan success callback may not be triggering properly
3. **Stock Matching:** The stock lookup logic may not be finding the correct stock item
4. **State Management:** React state updates may not be propagating correctly after scan

#### Test Coverage Summary
- ✅ Login with admin/admin credentials using specified selectors
- ✅ Navigation to Dispatch tab and page loading
- ✅ "Scan to Dispatch" button functionality
- ✅ Scanner dialog opening and initialization
- ✅ "Scan an Image File" link and file upload functionality
- ✅ QR code file upload process
- ✅ Bulk dispatch dialog structure and stock availability
- ⚠️ QR scan result processing and automatic stock addition
- ✅ Manual stock selection and dispatch form functionality

#### Key Features Verified
- ✅ Complete dispatch scanning infrastructure implemented
- ✅ File upload QR scanning capability working
- ✅ Stock data properly available and accessible
- ✅ Bulk dispatch dialog fully functional
- ✅ Stock selection and form validation working
- ✅ Professional UI/UX implementation
- ⚠️ Automatic QR-to-dispatch workflow needs verification

#### Minor Issue Identified
**QR Processing Workflow:** While the scanning infrastructure is complete and working, the automatic addition of scanned stock to dispatch may not be functioning as expected. The QR code content format or the scan result processing logic may need adjustment.

#### Recommendations for Main Agent
1. **Verify QR Content:** Check that /tmp/stock_qrcode.png contains plain text "STK-0001" (not JSON or other format)
2. **Debug Scan Callback:** Add console logging to the QR scan success callback to verify it's being triggered
3. **Test Stock Lookup:** Verify that the stock lookup logic `stocks.find(s => s.stock_code === decodedText)` is working correctly
4. **Check State Updates:** Ensure React state updates are properly triggering UI changes after successful scan

#### Test Environment Details
- **URL:** https://garmentpro-2.preview.emergentagent.com
- **Login Credentials:** admin/admin (using specified selectors)
- **Browser:** Playwright automation testing
- **Date:** 2025-12-20
